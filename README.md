# BookCycle 📚

*BookCycle* is a full-stack web platform for students to share, lend, and discover used textbooks within their local community, promoting sustainability and making education more accessible.

## The Problem

Many students buy expensive textbooks that are used for only one semester. Meanwhile, other students struggle to find affordable or available copies. This leads to:

-   💸 *Unnecessary Spending:* Students spend a significant amount of money on books with a short lifespan.
-   📚 *Wastage of Resources:* Perfectly good books gather dust on shelves or are thrown away.
-   📉 *Reduced Access:* High costs can limit students' access to essential learning materials.

## The Solution

BookCycle provides a centralized platform for students to:

-   *List* their used textbooks for lending or giving away.
-   *Search* for available books by title, subject, or college.
-   *Find* books nearby based on their current location.
-   *Request* to borrow books from other users.
-   *Chat* directly with lenders to coordinate a handoff.

It promotes a community of sharing among students while supporting sustainability and making education more accessible.
